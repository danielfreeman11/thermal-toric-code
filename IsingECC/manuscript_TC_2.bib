abstract = {We analyse stability of the four-dimensional Kitaev model - a candidate for scalable quantum memory - in finite temperature within the weak coupling Markovian limit. It is shown that, below a critical temperature, certain topological qubit observables X and Z possess relaxation times exponentially long in the size of the system. Their construction involves polynomial in system's size algorithm which uses as an input the results of measurements performed on all individual spins. We also discuss the drawbacks of such candidate for quantum memory and mention the implications of the stability of qubit for statistical mechanics.},

@article{Bardyn2015,
abstract = {We propose a simple yet efficient mechanism for passive error correction in topological quantum memories. Our scheme relies on driven-dissipative ancilla systems which couple to local excitations (anyons) and make them "sink" in energy, with no required interaction among ancillae or anyons. Through this process, anyons created by some thermal environment end up trapped in potential "trenches" that they themselves generate, which can be interpreted as a "memory foam" for anyons. This self-trapping mechanism provides an energy barrier for anyon propagation, and removes entropy from the memory by favoring anyon recombination over anyon separation (responsible for memory errors). We demonstrate that our scheme leads to an exponential increase of the memory-coherence time with system size L, up to an upper bound Lmax which can increase exponentially with $\Delta$/T, where T is the temperature and $\Delta$ is some energy scale defined by potential trenches. This results in a double exponential increase of the memory time with $\Delta$/T, which greatly improves over the Arrhenius (single-exponential) scaling found in typical quantum memories.},

abstract = {A big open question in the quantum information theory concerns feasibility of a self-correcting quantum memory. A quantum state recorded in such memory can be stored reliably for a macroscopic time without need for active error correction if the memory is put in contact with a cold enough thermal bath. In this paper we derive a rigorous lower bound on the memory time \$T\_\{mem\}\$ of the 3D Cubic Code model which was recently conjectured to have a self-correcting behavior. Assuming that dynamics of the memory system can be described by a Markovian master equation of Davies form, we prove that \$T\_\{mem\}\backslash ge L\^{}\{c\backslash beta\}\$ for some constant \$c>0\$, where \$L\$ is the lattice size and \$\backslash beta\$ is the inverse temperature of the bath. However, this bound applies only if the lattice size does not exceed certain critical value \$L\^{}*\backslash sim e\^{}\{\backslash beta/3\}\$. We also report a numerical Monte Carlo simulation of the studied memory indicating that our analytic bounds on \$T\_\{mem\}\$ are tight up to constant coefficients. In order to model the readout step we introduce a new decoding algorithm which might be of independent interest. Our decoder can be implemented efficiently for any topological stabilizer code and has a constant error threshold under random uncorrelated errors.},

abstract = {We describe four closely related Hubbard-like models (models A, B, C and D) of particles that can hop on a 2D Kagome lattice interacting via Coulomb repulsion. The particles can be either bosons (models A and B) or (spinless) fermions (models C and D). Models A and C also include a ring exchange term. In all four cases we solve equations in the model parameters to arrive at an exactly soluble point whose ground state manifold is the extensively degenerate ``d-isotopy space'' \$\backslash bar\{V\}\_d\$, 0<d<2. Near the ``special'' values, \$d = 2 \backslash cos \backslash pi/k+2\$, \$\backslash bar\{V\}\_d\$ should collapse to a stable topological phase with anyonic excitations closely related to SU(2) Chern-Simons theory at level k. We mention simplified models \$A\^{}-\$ and \$C\^{}-\$ which may also lead to these topological phases.},

@article{Ioffe2002,
abstract = {All physical implementations of quantum bits (or qubits, the logical elements in a putative quantum computer) must overcome conflicting requirements: the qubits should be manipulable through external signals, while remaining isolated from their environment. Proposals based on quantum optics emphasize optimal isolation, while those following the solid-state route exploit the variability and scalability of nanoscale fabrication techniques. Recently, various designs using superconducting structures have been successfully tested for quantum coherent operation, however, the ultimate goal of reaching coherent evolution over thousands of elementary operations remains a formidable task. Protecting qubits from decoherence by exploiting topological stability is a qualitatively new proposal that holds promise for long decoherence times, but its physical implementation has remained unclear. Here we show how strongly correlated systems developing an isolated twofold degenerate quantum dimer liquid ground state can be used in the construction of topologically stable qubits; we discuss their implementation using Josephson junction arrays. Although the complexity of their architecture challenges the technology base available today, such topological qubits greatly benefit from their built-in fault-tolerance.},

@article{Pastawski2009,
abstract = {The ability to protect quantum information from the effect of noise is one of the major goals of quantum information processing. In this article, we study limitations on the asymptotic stability of quantum information stored in passive N-qubit systems. We consider the effect of small imperfections in the implementation of the protecting Hamiltonian in the form of perturbations or weak coupling to a ground state environment. We prove that, regardless of the protecting Hamiltonian, there exists a perturbed evolution that necessitates a final error correcting step when the state of the memory is read. Such an error correction step is shown to require a finite error threshold, the lack thereof being exemplified by the 3D compass model. We go on to present explicit weak Hamiltonian perturbations which destroy the logical information stored in the 2D toric code in a time O(log(N)).},

@article{Wieland2003,
abstract = {The variance in the winding number of various random fractal curves, including the self-avoiding walk, the loop-erased random walk, contours of Fortuin-Kastelyn clusters, and stochastic Loewner evolution, has been studied by numerous researchers. Usually the focus has been on the winding at the end points. We measure the variance in winding number at typical points along the curve. More generally, we study the winding at points where k strands come together, and some adjacent strands may be conditioned not to hit each other. The measured values are consistent with an interesting conjecture.},
