This folder contains the old python code for toric code simulation.  This code is no longer under active development.

ContinuousTime.py contains the majority of the class definitions for actually performing the simulation.

Most of the other scripts are one-off scripts that were used to launch jobs on the cluster.  AnalysisSmart.py is a good example of one of these.
