This code simulates the 1D ising model at finite temperature and applies a fairly naiive error correction algorithm to it.

The most "mature" script is SingleShotLengthSweep.py.  The others are mainly copies of this script for performing parameter sweeps holding different things fixed.

For example, SingleShotLengthSweep varies system size for a parallel application of the error correcting algorithm, SingleShotLinearLengthSweep is the same, but for a serial application of the error correcting algorithm.  LambdaSweep and LambdaSweepSerial likewise sweep the \lambda parameter (see paper below) for parallel and serial application, respectively (holding length fixed).

For details of the error correction algorithm, see http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05005

In the interest of reproduceability, I've included my launch, analysis, and plotting scripts in Run folder.  It should be fairly straightforward to completely reproduce all of my figures if you follow the readme in that folder.
